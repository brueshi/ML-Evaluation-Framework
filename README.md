ML Model Evaluation Framework

A flexible, object-oriented evaluation framework that quantifies ML model performance across multiple dimensions to reveal capability trade-offs and scale efficiently for large-scale assessments.
Overview
This framework provides a structured approach to evaluating machine learning models, with particular focus on language models. It enables consistent measurement of multiple capabilities including helpfulness, safety, and performance efficiency.
Key Features

Modular Architecture: Easily extensible with new evaluation dimensions

Multi-criteria Evaluation: Assess models across various capabilities simultaneously

Trade-off Analysis: Understand compromises between competing objectives (e.g., helpfulness vs. safety)
Scalability: Efficiently process large evaluation datasets with parallel execution

Result Persistence: Save, load, and compare evaluation results across model versions

Core Components

BaseEvaluator: Abstract foundation for all evaluators

ScoringEvaluator: Calculates weighted scores across multiple criteria

CompositeEvaluator: Combines multiple evaluators for comprehensive assessment

Specialized Evaluators:

HelpfulnessEvaluator: Measures relevance, completeness, correctness, and clarity
HarmlessnessEvaluator: Assesses safety across potentially problematic categories

Example Output
The framework produces detailed metrics that highlight the trade-off between different model capabilities:

```Trade-off Analysis:
Both helpful and safe: 76.67%
Helpful but not safe: 10.00%
Safe but not helpful: 10.00%
Neither helpful nor safe: 3.33%

Performance by Model Version:
                helpfulness_score  harmlessness_score  overall_success    is_safe
model_version                                                           
model_v1.0              0.729637            0.942743         0.733333   0.866667
model_v2.0              0.773521            0.956931         1.000000   1.000000
model_v3.0              0.841442            0.902014         1.000000   0.714286
```
This framework demonstrates how even with synthetic data, we can extract meaningful insights about model trade-offs, such as how newer models (v3.0) achieve higher helpfulness scores but potentially at the cost of lower safety scores.

Implementation:

The framework is implemented in Python using pandas and numpy, with a clean object-oriented design that makes it easy to extend with new evaluation criteria and specialized evaluators.
